## Updates / Contributions Welcome - Please Update the Football.TXT Sources

Note: The Football.JSON files get (auto-)generated using the datasets in the Football.TXT format, thus, **please do NOT
edit the (auto-)generated JSON files but the Football.TXT sources in the tournament repos** e.g.:

- European Football Championship ("Euro") in [**`/euro`**](https://github.com/openfootball/euro)
- and so on

and than (auto-)generate the euro.json updates. If you only edit / patch the (auto-)generated JSON files without updating
the sources than your changes will get lost / overwritten with the next update.
